# Project Title
Fuel Consumption Prediction

# Description
The Fuel Consumption Predictor is a Machine Learning model designed to forecast the amount of fuel a vehicle will consume during a trip. It considers factors such as vehicle type, engine specifications, driving behavior, and route characteristics to make its predictions.

# Dataset and Feature Information
Odometer -> Total distance ran by a vehicle (in kms)                          
Total Travelled (Kms) -> Total distance ran by a vehicle (in kms)                                         
Fuel Efficiency -> Fuel Efficiency of a vehicle for per litre fuel                            
Fuel Consumed: Fuel consumed on a historical trip                      
Total Time Total Minutes -> Total time taken for a trip                                      
Idling Total Minutes -> Total time for the vehicle was in idling state                               
Night Driving Total Minutes -> Total time for the vehicle was driven at night                                        
Stoppage Total Minutes -> Total time when the vehicle was stopped                                    
Stopped Percentage -> Percentage of overall trip when vehicle was in stopped state                            
Moving Percentage -> Percentage of overall trip when vehicle was in moving state                            
Idling Percentage -> Percentage of overall trip when vehicle was in idling state                            
Harsh Acceleration -> Count of event Harsh Acceleration                                   
Harsh Braking -> Count of event Harsh Braking                                    
Model Name -> Model of the Vehicle                               
Fuel type -> Fuel type
